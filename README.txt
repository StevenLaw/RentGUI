This repository contains the GUI layer of a rental management system that started as a group project for an object oriented analysis and design course

The people involved in this project were:

<ul>
<li>me (Steven Law)</li>
<li>Charanjeev Johal</li>
<li>Charles Salonga</li>
</ul>

The main body of the course involved the creation of diagrams to aid the creation of a complex project.  Most of this work was done collaboratively.  The code was produced by me as a demonstration of how the final product would work.
